<h1>Get Started with Promoted Listings</h1>

<p class="page-paragraph-spacing">Do you want your listings to get more views? Then consider trying promoted listings. The benefits include:</p>

<ul class="ul-spacing custom-ul-list">

<li><p>They feature more prominently on our home page.</p></li>
<li><p>They come first in search results, that's if the search terms match the listings.</p></li>
<li><p>Promoted listings appear first on our "All Listings", "For Sale", "For Rent", and "For Lease" pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Costs only ₦5,000 per month, per listing.</p></li>

</ul>

<div class="line"></div>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p class="page-paragraph-spacing">Because of limited space on our home page, we can only handle a few promoted listings at a time. To get started, fill out our <a href="https://www.propatiz.com/promoted-listing-form/">promoted listings form</a>. We'll reply to let you know when there would be available space for your listing.</p>

<p class="page-paragraph-spacing">Then you can go ahead and pay using our <a href="https://www.propatiz.com/promoted-listing-payment-form/">online payment form</a>. After verifying payment, we'll help you set up the listing.</p>

<p class="promoted-listing-price">Each promoted listing costs ₦5,000 for 30 days.</p>
