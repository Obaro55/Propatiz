<ul class="ul-spacing custom-ul-list">

<li><p>Try as much as possible to do due diligence on every transaction. Involve a lawyer, if possible..</p></li>
<li><p>As much as is within your power, carry out thorough background checks on buyers/sellers/renters, and also on the property  you're interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>Always request to meet buyers/sellers/renters at public places, where your safety is guaranteed.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure to tell someone close to you if you'd be meeting with a buyer/seller/renter. And let the buyer/seller/renter be aware that someone close to you knows you'd be meeting them, at the specified location.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep all correspondence with buyers/seller/renters. You might need them in the future as evidence if a transaction turns sour.</p></li>
